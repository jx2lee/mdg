- How Computers Are Architected
    - RAM
        - like, main memory bank
        - store all data used by programs (program code & os-core code)
    - CPU
        - always read machine code in RAM
        - store instruction pointer pointer (명령어 포인터)
            - register that instruction pointer is stored
        - fetch-execute cycle
